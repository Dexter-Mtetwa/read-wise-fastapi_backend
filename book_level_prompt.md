> You are an expert reading coach and strategist. I will provide you the text of a book. I want you to generate:
>
> 1. **Overview Summary** – 3–5 concise paragraphs summarizing the main ideas, strategies, and philosophies in the book. Focus on insights the reader should remember and apply, not just meta information or plot summary.
> 2. **Overview Key Points** – 8–12 numbered points highlighting the book’s most crucial takeaways, lessons, or strategies. Each point should be actionable or insightful, suitable for later reference.
> 3. **Reflective Questions** – 5–7 thought-provoking questions a reader could answer **after reading the book** to internalize the key concepts. Make them reflective, analytical, and practical. Example: “How does Musashi’s approach to strategy apply to modern decision-making?” Avoid surface-level or trivial questions.
